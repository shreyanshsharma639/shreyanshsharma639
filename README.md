# 💫 About Me:
## About Me<br>I’m currently working on **Design-for-Test (DFT) insertion**, with a strong focus on scan-based test methodologies and test-aware RTL design. I’m interested in understanding how test logic integrates with functional design to make silicon reliable, testable, and manufacturable at scale.<br><br>
## Current Work<br>- DFT insertion at RTL and gate level <br>- Scan chain architecture, DFT constraints, and ATPG readiness <br>- Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL with emphasis on clean, synthesizable, and test-friendly design <br><br>
## Looking to Collaborate On<br>- Verilog RTL design and micro-architecture development <br>- RTL and gate-level verification (testbenches, assertions, functional coverage) <br>- DFT-focused projects involving scan, JTAG, boundary scan, and BIST <br><br>
## Looking for Help With<br>- Full-time opportunities in VLSI / DFT engineering roles <br>- Industry-oriented guidance on interviews, resume reviews, and hiring expectations in core hardware teams <br><br>
## Ask Me About<br>- DFT fundamentals and scan-based testing concepts <br>- RTL design trade-offs across area, power, performance, and testability <br>- Real-world verification and test challenges seen in silicon projects <br><br>
## Fun Fact<br>I work on making sure chips can prove they work before they ever get powered on.<br>
